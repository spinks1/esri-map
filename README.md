## RETIREMENT NOTICE (December 2021)

> As of ArcGIS API for JavaScript version 4.22 (December 2021) this repository is retired. For more information see this issue: https://github.com/Esri/angular-cli-esri-map/issues/114. 

## DEPRECATION NOTICE (December 2020)

> As of ArcGIS API for JavaScript version 4.18 (December 2020) this repository is deprecated. The Angular integration patterns shown here are for verions 4.17 and earlier of the API.

## Why is this repo being deprecated?

At version 4.18 we released ES modules for the API that will ship alongside the existing AMD modules. This repo relies on patterns for integrating AMD modules, which is how we've shipped the API since version 4.0. 

For more information on which modules you should use consult the SDK's [Introduction to tooling](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/guide/tooling-intro/) Guide page.

## Where can I find samples using the new ES modules?

Samples using the ES modules are available on the [`jsapi-resources`](https://github.com/Esri/jsapi-resources/tree/master/esm-samples) github repository. Documentation on using the ES modules is in the SDK's [Build with ES modules](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/guide/es-modules/) Guide page.

## What's in this repo?

**This repo is for versions 4.17 and earlier of the ArcGIS API for JavaScript, or if you are using Dojo 1 or RequireJS.**

The `master` branch contains a simple but complete application that uses the ArcGIS API for JavaScript, an enterprise geospatial API, and Angular CLI. It uses esri-loader, a small library that lazy loads ArcGIS JavaScript API modules via CDN using a `loadModules()` method. The esri-loader pattern works with just about any build tool and bundler.

The [`@arcgis-webpack-angular`](https://github.com/Esri/angular-cli-esri-map/tree/arcgis-webpack-angular) branch is for local builds using native `import` statements.

## IE and Edge Legacy support

**IMPORTANT:** Version 4.17 of the ArcGIS API for JavaScript is the last version of the API to support IE11 and Edge Legacy. 

## Dependencies

This repo is only tested to work with the most current version of the following dependencies:

- [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)
- [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/)
- [esri-loader](https://github.com/Esri/esri-loader)
